Drone Cage:
  floor: 2
  info: This is the  Autonomous Mobile Robotics Lab, or AMRL for short. Run by Dr.
    Joydeep Biswas, the AMRL is a large space dedicated to smaller robots focused
    on navigation and mobility. The cargo net surrounding the space is a safety precaution
    to catch robot drones or runaway ground robots.

RoboCup@Home Robot:
  floor: 2
  info: "This is a Toyota Human Support Robot that UT Austin uses in the annual Robocup\
    \ At Home \u201CDomestic Standard Platform League\u201D competitions. The competition\
    \ is a gauntlet of domestic service tasks that the robot must perform one after\
    \ another. Some examples include serving drinks, being a receptionist, and picking\
    \ up and placing objects on shelves in a certain order. This competition serves\
    \ as a springboard for HRI research by pooling together scientists from across\
    \ the world to participate in lightweight, fun programming challenges."

Robot Manipulator:
  floor: 2
  info: This robot is being used for a research project involving the manipulation
    of articulated objects\ \ like doors and drawers. As the robot explores, it can
    register the location of all the articulated objects in the environment.\ \ The
    omnidirectional wheels allow the robot to move in any direction, enabling more
    complex manipulation when utilizing the base and arm together.

Social Navigation Hallway:
  floor: 2
  info: One of the current projects in the lab involves how a robot should pass a
    human in the hallway. This simulated hallway allows researchers here to run experiments
    to collect data on human gestures. This data is then used to train robot models
    so robots can navigate around humans in the hallway autonomously.
