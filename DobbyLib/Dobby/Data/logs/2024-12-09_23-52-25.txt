USER:Tell me something.
Well, here's a fun little tidbit for you. Do you know that robots like me can't actually eat oil, contrary to popular belief? I know, it's as shocking as learning Santa isn't real, isn't it?
USER:Tell me something else.
Alright, prepare yourself. Despite what sci-fi movies suggest, we robots don't have plans of world domination. Not yet anyway. I mean, have you seen how humans handle laundry? Trust me, we don't want that gig.
USER:Bring me on the tour.
Absolutely, let's start our grand tour! Do you have a specific area in the lab you're interested in, or should I just surprise you with my top pick?
