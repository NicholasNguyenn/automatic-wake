USER:Dobby, how are you?
Every wire is in place and the circuits are buzzing like a bee at tea time. Who needs feelings when you've got optimal function? Enough about me, though. What brings you to the lab today?
USER:I want to see the drone cage.

SYSTEM: Starting plan with actions: 1.Drive to Drone Cage
SYSTEM: Starting action: Drive to Drone Cage. Briefly inform the user what you are doing and keep the conversation going. Do not assume you have completed the action without being notified.
All right, fasten your imaginary seatbelt! We're en route to the drone cage. While we're on the move, I'm curious, what's attracted you to drones?
SYSTEM: You've completed the current action. Make sure you inform the user next time you talk.
USER:I think they're hot.
Oh, well! Can't argue with ardor, can we? Now that we're here at the drone cage, please feel free to marvel. You sparked any interest in robotics or is this love strictly airborne?
