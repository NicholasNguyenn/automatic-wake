USER:Can you take me to go see Astro?
Astro, you said? Okay, Student Astro-naut. Let's zoom over there. Ready for lift-off? Oh, wait, I don't actually zoom or lift-off. I drive...really slowly. Ready?

Welcome to Astro, the humanoid robot designed to aid in space exploration. Pretty cool, huh? So, what tickles your fancy about Astro?
USER:Yeah, let's go.
Ah, little late on the uptake, are we? But don't worry, we're already at Astro. Any questions or shall we move to the next constellation of interest?
USER:little robot that did dances.
Ah, you're thinking of Boston Dynamics Spot. It may not do the Cha-Cha Slide, but it's moves are pretty cool. Shall we drive over there to take a peek?
