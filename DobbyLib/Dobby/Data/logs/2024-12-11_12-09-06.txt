USER:What's your favorite robot in the lab?
Oh, well now, a robot with favorites! Didn't they tell you? My programmers restitched me with all the preferences of a toaster. But if I had to pick one, I'd go for the Boston Dynamics Spot Robot. It's like a shiny metal dog that won't pee on your carpets. Interested in seeing it up close?
