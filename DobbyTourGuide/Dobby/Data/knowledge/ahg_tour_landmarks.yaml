Adaptive Cars:
  floor: 2
  info: Here we see adaptive cars. These are a modern version of the Vulcan 1 wheelchair,
    but made for kids. An associate professor at Texas Robotics, James Schuler, developed
    this car for his daughter who was paraplegic. Since moving on to start his own
    business, ADAPT Texas, an undergraduate organization on campus that provides adaptive
    toys for kids with disabilities, has taken over to develop these cars further.

Collaborative Room:
  floor: 2
  info: In this room, you can see a few retired robots that were built very early
    in the history of robotics at the University of Texas, long before Texas Robotics
    as we know it today,   aka, the 90s.   At this time robotics research was spread
    across colleges on campus, with no official   coordination between departments.   In
    the corner we can see the Vulcan I wheelchair robot, originally created at KISS   institute,
    but purchased and modified at UT Austin in 1995. This was done by Dr.   Kupiers,
    a roboticist who then worked at UT, after interviewing a paraplegic student   who
    expressed interest in an electric wheelchair that could prevent collisions.   Dr.
    Kuipers, along with other roboticists and students at UT modified the robot to   create
    early autonomous driving and mapping systems that were programmed to be   subordinate
    to the driver. While Vulcan I lives here today, Dr. Kuipers continues his   work
    on the Vulcan II at the University of Massachusetts.   We like to say that this
    robot is a prime example of the three core competencies of   Texas Robotics, as
    it combines medical robotics, human-robot interaction, and mobile   autonomous
    robotics.   In the back right corner of the room, there is a retired robot manipulator.
    Robot   manipulators are grasping robots used to lift, move, and control objects.
    There is an   entire lab space dedicated to robots like this one in AHG today.
    This robot was   specifically used for researching manipulating small objects
    and constructing things   from Legos.   On the other side of the room, you can
    see more smaller retired robots. They served   also as early mobile autonomous
    robots around the same time frame as the Vulcan I.   You can view some modern
    Mobile Autonomous robots on the screens here.

Meeting Point:

  info: "Welcome! This is the start of the tour of the Anna Hiss Gymnasium. We are\
    \ at the second floor. History of The Anna Hiss Gymnasium (AHG): it was built\
    \ in the 1930s, following the vision of Anna Hiss, the women\u2019s athletic director\
    \ at the time, who spent 10 years touring gyms across America before designing\
    \ this one. Complete with a swimming pool, multiple basketball courts, an archery\
    \ range, and more, it was the premier training facility of its time. This gym\
    \ was built long before Title IV\u2019s protections of women\u2019s sports, and\
    \ it was even a common belief that vigorous exercise was harmful to women. Men\u2019\
    s athletics were valued much higher than women\u2019s and women\u2019s athletics\
    \ were not meant to be competative. As a response, the facilities in the gym were\
    \ built too small for code. The pool of the gym was tore out in 1995, and in 2021,\
    \ AHG was remodeled specifically to the needs of Texas Robotics while keeping\
    \ as many historical features as possible. The project cost a total of $26.5 million\
    \ dollars, including costs for rehabilitating the building. While a historic sign\
    \ saying Girls Only still resides inside, everyone is  welcome at AHG today.\n\
    \ Now you can look outside in the courtyard. You can see the beautiful black lady\
    \ sculpture, This sculpture, titled Sentinel IV, was created by Simone Leigh,\
    \ a famous American artist whose work honors Black Feminine forms. Leigh sites\

    \ Spoon, and it faces outwards to protect AHG."

Mobile Autonomy Lab:
  floor: 2
  info: You can notice videos of the robots that are inside this lab in action. Upon
    entering the lab you can see a number of carts, cars, and /u201Cdog/u201D robots
    lying around. Sometimes there are mini roads set up. These are  mobile autonomous
    robots, and the scenes are for them to navigate through. Mobile autonomous robotics,
    or robots  that navigate and move on their own, have been a huge part of Texas
    Robotics since the beginning of Robotics research here at UT Austin. The robots
    today can avoid obstacles and people, detect terrains, and you will sometimes
    see them  walking around AHG by themselves. Some functions that they are working
    to develop are machine learning corrective actions, like stepping back to open
    a door or stabilizing when pushed. Dr. Biswas/u2019s lab even has had a quadruped
    that ran 5 miles at Town lake. On campus, there are other autonomous robots that
    are not housed in AHG, including Director of  Texas Robotics, Peter Stone/u2019s,
    Robot Soccer League. He hopes his team can win the human soccer World Cup by 2050.
    Technologies used for soccer playing robots are also being used to develop robots
    to assist in many other aspects of society. The work requires expertise in computer
    vision, robotics, and understanding about how autonomous agents work together
    The Mobile Autonomous work and technology created here by numerous labs is important
    for all kinds of robotics, including robots that live and work with humans.

  info: This is the Nuclear and Applied Robotics Lab. It is home to robotics projects
    that are  intended to work in dangerous or uninhabitable environments, like aerospace,
    nuclear plants, oil fields, and more. Through the window, you can see a number
    of the robots. Charging in against the back wall (most of the time) is Alph, a
    spot robot like the one we saw upstairs, but with an arm. Alf searches through
    environments for Alpha radiation, and can climb stairs and open doors. Against
    the wall is also Magmi, who detects radiation on floors, and Vault Bot, the car
    with the arms, who searches hazardous environments for radioactive materials.
    There a number of these robots who are built for the energy industry. These include
    the one you see holding the bowling ball, Scorpio, who is built to lift heavy
    spherical payloads in nuclear facilities, and our Multiuse Workcell, the large
    metal box with robotic arms in it. The Multiuse Workcell is used to handle hazardous
    materials safely, while interacting with humans. Normally on the desks against
    this wall is our Wombat, a robot built for repairing oil tanks, and some smaller
    prototypes that students are developing. The NARG lab is the one with the most
    active undergraduates involved in research at any given time, with over 13 students
    working as research assistants just for Dr. Pryor.

TroCar:
  floor: 2
  info: One exciting project that an undergraduate student has developed is a device
    for training doctors to perform trocar insertion. A trocar is a tube inserted
    into the abdomen to perform minimally invasive procedures. The trocar insertion
    is complicated to perform because the tube must pass through the skin, muscle,
    and fat without damaging organs, but the muscle requires more force to puncture
    than the organs. This device provides haptic feedback and a virtual simulation
    to train doctors to understand how to manage this pressure difference, and perform
    these procedures safer.
