Building Wide Intelligence Lab: The Building Wide Intelligence Lab, or BWI Lab for short, builds robots with the intention for them to become permanent parts of a buildingâ€™s experience. Run by Dr. Peter Stone, this lab hopes to integrate their research projects into UT buildings like the Gates Dell Complex to assist in navigating humans and giving them helpful information about events and activities within said building.
Living with Robots Lab: The Living With Robots Lab, run by Dr. Justin Hart, focuses on the domestic side of HRI. The projects built in this lab are created with the purpose of serving humans in common areas such as living spaces and receptionist desks. This lab is currently developing a robot that can autonomously run tours of UT Austin and the Anna Hiss Gymnasium.
FRI: As an undergraduate, it can be difficult to get into research. The Freshman Research Initiative, or FRI for short, helps with that by allowing undergraduates to participate in cutting edge research. Dr. Justin Hart leads the Autonomous Robots stream of FRI. In the first course of the program, students will learn about how research in robotics is conducted, current problems/avenues of new research, and work on a project of their own. In the second course of the program, students are able to work on an independent research project for a whole semester with the intention of publishing a paper.
FRI Summer Fellowship: The Freshman Research Initiative Summer Fellowship is one continuation of the FRI program. Fellows in the Autonomous Robots stream will work in the Living With Robots Lab on concurrent projects that Graduates or PhD students are working towards. In some cases, the fellows can develop their own research project.
Robotics Minor: The Minor in Robotics is intended for undergraduate students who wish to develop proficiencies in the interdisciplinary field of robotics while pursuing a major in a related field. This helps provide a more well-rounded education because robotics requires skills that span many different fields of studies, such as computer science, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering.
