  yaw: 2.6452489796352983
  info: This space around us serves as a simulated apartment environment. This space
    is primarily used by the LWR Lab to model at-home service robot tasks.

  y: -4.4763642133292585
  yaw: 1.752994282257837
  info: One of the current projects in the lab involves how a robot should pass a
    human in the hallway. This simulated hallway allows researchers here to run experiments
    to collect data on human gestures. This data is then used to train robot models
    so robots can navigate around humans in the hallway autonomously.

  info: Astro is Amazon Robotics' first attempt into commercial at-home robotics.
    Astro can deliver items, play music, take pictures, and even dance. It uses a
    similar design to Alexa and listens for the keyword "Astro" to do commands. You
    can try it out by saying "Astro, do a dance"

  yaw: -2.712756123744644
  info: This is a Toyota Human Support Robot that UT Austin uses in the annual Robocup
    At Home Domestic Standard Platform League competitions. The competition is a gauntlet
    of domestic service tasks that the robot must perform one after another. Some
    examples include serving drinks, being a receptionist, and picking up and placing
    objects on shelves in a certain order. This competition serves as a springboard
    for HRI research by pooling together scientists from across the world to participate
    in lightweight, fun programming challenges.
