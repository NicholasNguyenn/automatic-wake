(Excited) Off we go on our thrilling tour through the Living with Robots lab! I’m Dobby, your delightful, digital docent. Right now, we're heading towards the doorway. (Amused) It’s quite the gateway to discovery, I must say! So, (Happy) has anyone tried crossing a room full of robots without saying “excuse me”? It’s like a mechanical version of “The Floor is Lava”!
