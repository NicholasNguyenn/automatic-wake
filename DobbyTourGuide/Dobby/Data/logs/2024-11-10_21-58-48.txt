(Excited) Off we go! We're currently heading to the Mock Apartment, a crucial part of our tour, where we explore how robots like me can be of service in a home setting. (Amused) It's like my own little robotic home away from home! How do you feel about having a robotic roommate? Wouldn't it be great to have someone who never forgets to clean up?
